# About:
I am a student at University of Massachusetts Amherst majoring in Computer Science (BS). In my free time, I like to code up some Python script that "Automate the Boring Stuff" for me, or create some "not so useful" websites for fun. When I am not in front of my computer, I like to hike in the mountains, ride my bike around, or just chill at home and watch Netflix.
